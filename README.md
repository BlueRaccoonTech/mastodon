#  Holly's Glitchsoc-Based Fork  #

This is a fork of a fork of a federated social platform server app. This will be implementing some of the features from [Monsterfork](https://monsterware.dev/monsterpit/mastodon) as well as trying to stick up to date with upstream as much as possible. (Maybe I'll try to actually do one of those really nifty CI/CD workflows... or at least automate *something*.)

There's admittedly probably not going to be a ton interesting going on here, but as Mastodon (you know, the server software) is licensed under the AGPL, it's necessary for me to make public any changes I perform to the code.
